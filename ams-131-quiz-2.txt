1.~Each year starts on one of the seven days (Sunday through Saturday). Each year is either a leap year (i.e., it includes February 29) or not. How many different calendars are possible for a year? Explain briefly.

2.~A box contains 100 balls, of which $r$ are red. Suppose that the balls are drawn from the box one at a time, at random \textbf{without replacement}. Determine
\begin{itemize}

\item[(a)] 

the probability that the first ball drawn will be red; 

\item[(b)] 

the probability that the 50th ball drawn will be red; and 

\item[(c)] 

the probability that the last ball drawn will be red.

\end{itemize}

Explain briefly in each case. \textit{Hint:} Imagine that the 100 balls are randomly ordered in a list, and then drawn in that order, which is equivalent to sampling at random without replacement. \textit{Further Hint:} When choosing a sample $( Y_1, Y_2 )$ of size 2 at random without replacement from the population $\{ 1, 2, 7 \}$ in class on Monday, what was the relationship between $P ( Y_1 = 7 )$ and $P ( Y_2 = 7 )$?
