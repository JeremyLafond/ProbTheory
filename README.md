# ProbTheory
I basically wrote the solution manual to this class in LaTeX. . . IT WAS NOT WORTH IT

PDFS are compiled
.txt are uncompiled in LaTeX

I guess if I ever wanted to typeset a textbook or research paper this would be useful stuff. but really it just makes things a little easier to digest as this class had some nasty Calculus and difficult notation.
